                    CHAPTER 3 - METHODOLOGY
Chapter Preface
This chapter describes the methodology used to collect the data for the research
objective outlined in Chapter 1. In many research projects, several methods may be
used for research. Increasingly authors and researchers who work in organizations and
with managers often argue that one should attempt to mix methods to some extent,
because it provides more perspectives on the phenomena being studied (Easterby,
1991) and the same theory is recommended in PhD theses (Gable, 1994). This chapter
considers the selection of an appropriate approach to achieve the research objective.



3.1 Methodology
This chapter was written to identify which was the best method to use to carry out the
research subject. Material on different types of methodologies was gathered from
books, the Internet, and previous PhD thesis referred at Loughborough University
library. This chapter discusses the general overview of methods used. However, the
detailed methodology of how research was carried out is described in each chapter at
the beginning on how the material was gathered.



3.2 Introduction
Research is a process of enquiry or examination designed to discover information or
relationships, influenced by its environment and its historic nature (as it is impossible
to collect and analyze data simultaneously).


Due to the nature of the subject, E-commerce presents a significant obstacle to the
academic seeking to undertake and present high quality research. The reasons are its
recent emergence, the rapid change, and media hype.

Methodology                                                                 Chapter 3

The author has used the following terms for the research approach for the thesis
   •   Research methodology refers to the study of research methods.
   •   Research technique mean the approach or tool used, whereby data is gathered
       and analyzed, and results drawn
   •   Research method refers to the way a particular research project is undertaken.


For the author, what was important in deciding what research method to use depended
on each individual circumstance and decision on what techniques and methodology
were appropriate and would achieve the objective set. Most importantly, research in
E-commerce needed to reflect the state of knowledge when the research project
commenced so as to advance knowledge and present an original piece of work.
Research had to be practical; likely to be publishable and research had to be ambitious.


3.3 Factors influencing the research
Some of the difficulties in conducting research on E-commerce were because
established theories were in short supply when the author commenced the PhD in 1999.
Models of consumer behavior were lacking in the context of Internet where few
theories existed. Most E-commerce technologies and applications are new and so too
are organizations and individuals who apply them. The period during which the results
of a well-performed cross-sectional study are valid may be so short that publication is
not possible as results become outdated too quickly. Due to the changing nature of the
subject and uncertainty, the researcher can be defined as a participant of the research
context. For example, when the author conducted interviews with retail managers and
used questionnaires there was an exchange of ideas and opinions, which shed light on
subjects giving the researcher an opportunity to learn.


Certain external factors were considered when selecting the research technique to use.
A national study on applying strategy was deemed inappropriate for in depth analysis
and therefore a case study format was used.           Some telephone interviews and
questionnaires were used to avoid the cost of traveling to companies.

3.4 Research methods available
“Quantitative” and “Qualitative” are terms used to describe the nature of the data that is
gathered in empirical research (Van Maanen, 1979) and both are used in the author’s
research.


Empirical research is research based on observations of the real world comprising of
objects and processes. This real world cannot be directly understood by humans, nor
‘captured’ into human artifacts. However, through observation humans can form
theories as to how it came to be the way it is, and how and why the processes take
place. In gathering data to test a hypothesis, active observation is guided by theory and
only relevant data is gathered to test the research objective.


Where no appropriate theory can be found as a basis of research, exploratory research
can be carried out. This involves open-ended study, not supported by theory and
provides new body of empirical knowledge from which theories might arise.


The author used an Interpretvisit research technique (Galliers, 1992) where the focus is
on openness to alternative perspectives and to identify any ambiguity in the data and
setting. Interpretive research is where the researcher gathers data and analysis using
their own intuition. The author used focus group research, which involved gathering a
group of people together to discuss a topic. The purpose was to raise concerns, issues,
impacts and implications of the subject under discussion (Clarke, 1999).


Field studies were undertaken by the author at various client sites, the object of these
studies is to gather data by direct observation (Klein and Myers, 1999), though in the
author’s research most of the fieldwork consisted of conducting interviews and using
questionnaires. Questionnaires were also used during interviews where the questions
gave structure to the interviews. A secondary research method was also used where,
rather than producing new data, the contents of existing literature and documents were
analyzed.

______________________________________________________________________

Case studies involve an attempt to describe relationships that exist in reality, very often
in a single organization. Case studies may be positivist or interpretivist in nature,
depending on the approach of the researcher, the data collected and the analytical
techniques   employed.     Reality   can   be   captured    in   greater   detail   by   an
observer-researcher, with the analysis of more variables than is typically possible in
experimental and survey research.


However, case studies can be considered weak as they are typically restricted to a
single organization, and it is difficult to generalize findings since it is hard to find
similar cases with similar data that can be analyzed in a statistically meaningful way.
Different researchers can have different interpretations of the same data, thus adding
research bias into the equation. Researchers have used the case study research method
for many years across a variety of disciplines. Social scientists, in particular, have
made wide use of this qualitative research method to examine contemporary real-life
situations and provide the basis for the application of ideas and extension of methods.
Yin (1984) defines the case study research method as an empirical inquiry that
investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the
boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which
multiple sources of evidence are used.



Critics of the case study method believe that the study of a small number of cases can
offer no grounds for establishing reliability or generality of findings. Others feel that
the intense exposure to study of the case biases the findings. Some dismiss case study
research as useful only as an exploratory tool. Yet researchers continue to use the case
study research method with success in carefully planned and crafted studies of real-life
situations, issues, and problems.


Simulation involves copying the behavior of a system. Simulation is used in situations
where it would be difficult normally to solve problems analytically, and it typically

Methodology                                                                   Chapter 3

involves the introduction of random variables. As with experimental forms of research,
it is difficult to make a simulation sufficiently realistic so that it resembles real world
events. The newness and uncertainties of E-commerce meant that it was not only
difficult to produce a realistic simulation for E-commerce, but it was also difficult to
even know how realistic or unrealistic any simulation would be. For this reason,
simulation is not used in this research.


The author as part of her research used the case study approach, which has been
defined below along with the justification for using the approach for her research.




3.5 Case study approach
The underlying principle of the case study approach is to study solutions to current
problems and, thus, it was an ideal approach to use as the author’s subject,
E-commerce, is continually changing and has to be examined at a particular point in
time. The term “case study” implies a fairly intensive examination of what has
happened in a single bounded context and time (Dockerell and Hamilition, 1980). It
helps to explore, unravel and understand problems, issues and relationships in a
particular situation.


There are a number of important articles describing the case study approach to
research. Key among these is Benbasat et al.'s (1987) paper with its comprehensive
definitions and suggestions for the conduct of case research. The case study is
considered by Benbasat et al. (1987) to be viable for three reasons.


    •   As a study can be conducted in a natural setting
    •   The researcher can ask "how" and "why" questions, so as to understand the
        nature and complexity of the processes taking place.

Methodology                                                                  Chapter 3
______________________________________________________________________

   •   Research can be conducted in an area where few, if any, previous studies have
       been undertaken.


Case studies can be defined in various ways, and a standard does not exist. However, a
definition compiled from a number of sources Jackson (2001), Stone (1978), Benbasat
(1984), Yin (1984), Bonoma (1985) and Kaplan (1985) in Benbasat et al. (1987), is as
follows:


   •   A case study examines a phenomenon in its natural setting, employing multiple
       methods of data collection to gather information from one or a few entities
       (people, groups or organizations). The boundaries of the phenomenon are not
       clearly evident at the outset of the research and no experimental control or
       manipulation is used.


The case study approach is surrounded with skepticism, much of which rests on the
view that generalizing from the results of a small number of studies is not possible.
Gummerson (1991) notes that however well they are planned, case studies lack the
scientific weight and general applicability of conventional research methods. However
in certain areas they represent the only possible research strategy, as was the case for
the author to achieve the proposed research objective.


The principle criticism of case studies in research is that they are unrepresentative.
Theoretical conclusions derived from case studies cannot be considered valid unless
the cases can be demonstrated to be typical of the phenomena under investigation
(Smith, 1991). Mitchel (1983) takes a slightly different view reporting that the extent to
which generalizations may be made from case studies depends upon the adequacy of
the underlying theory and the corpus of related knowledge of which the case is
analyzed rather than on the particular instance itself. Bryman (1978) dismisses the
argument about generalization writing that case studies should instead be ‘evaluated in
terms of the adequacy of the theoretical influences that are generated’. The aim is not

Methodology                                                                 Chapter 3
______________________________________________________________________

to infer the findings from a sample to a population, but to engender patterns and
linkages of theoretical importance.


It must be accepted that any case study will be unique and therefore not representative
of other instances, but this absence of rigorous control is both a strength and a
weakness of the approach.


Case studies were a dominant feature of this research; the approach was taken since it
was considered to be the most appropriate to develop understanding about the
company’s feasibility of offering E-commerce and to develop rich case descriptions
needed to build theoretical understanding. However, it was acknowledged that case
studies were not universally accepted as a rigorous research method. According to Yin
(1994), case studies have been viewed as a weak relation of other research methods. He
suggested, however, that this stereotype is wrong, and that case studies are most
appropriate for certain conditions.


“In general, case studies are the preferred strategy when ‘how’ or ‘why’ questions are
being posed, when the investigator has little control over events, and when the focus is
contemporary phenomenon within some real life context” (Yin, 1994).


This view was used to judge the suitability of case studies for this research. The
research aimed to explore the feasibility of E-commerce and develop a methodology
for creating an E-commerce strategy. The exploratory nature of the research does
correspond to the ‘how’ and ‘why’ approach which would indicate the value of case
studies in this research.


The single case study, although a common feature of social research, has been shown
to be particularly appropriate when testing formulated theory, or when multiple
examples do not exist. Single case studies can be used for the pilot stage of any case

Methodology                                                                  Chapter 3

study based research. If there is a need to focus on events in a natural setting, clearly
there are advantages to using a case study.


The same is also true if it is a theory building research project and there is no strong
theoretical base for the research (Jackson, 2001). Benbasat et al (1987) confirm this,
stating “A rich and natural setting can be fertile ground for generating theories”.
However, a case study would not be appropriate if there were a need for control or
manipulation of variables. These considerations again show that a case study approach
is suitable for this research. The aim is to produce practical guidelines for managers
considering E-commerce, so the “natural” setting of real businesses attempting to
pursue real E-commerce ventures is not only appropriate, but essential. Furthermore,
the lack of existing theories and models means this research requires a theory building
component, which again suggests a case study approach.


An important issue was how many case studies to select. Yin (1994) described the
options available, either a single case study or multiple case studies. Generally
speaking it is more valid and generalisable, to include multiple cases, though there are
instances where a single case is instructive (Lee, 1989). Exploratory studies are
generally better served by single cases, where there is no previous theory. A single case
can also be used to test an existing, well-formed theory. Multiple cases are preferable
when the purpose of the research is to describe phenomena, and to develop and test
theories. In this research, both single and multiple case studies have been used. For
example, a single company’s (In2netlogic) experiences were used to derive the initial
draft of the twenty key questions for managers described in Chapter 5. However, these
questions were tested, first in a focus group consisting of managers from a number of
companies, and later in an in-depth feasibility study in Chapter 9.


As has already been indicated, case studies require multiple data collection methods,
the results of which hopefully converge, in order to establish construct validity. Yin
(1984) identifies these methods as including:

   •   direct observation of activities and phenomena and their environment;
   •   indirect observation or measurement of process-related phenomena;
   •   interviews –(structured or unstructured);
   •   documentation, such as written, printed or electronic information about the
       company and its operations (also newspaper cuttings);
   •   records and charts about previous use of technology relevant to the case.
   (Yin, 1984)


The case study approach was the most suitable for the author’s research into the
feasibility of offering E-commerce and on helping to identify success and failures
affecting companies by using NSB contacts. The case study approach helped build the
author’s theories in a relatively new area of research. Using multiple data collection
methods, as advocated by Yin, the author also carried out face-to-face interviews,
telephone interviews, questionnaires, observations during NSB meetings, and studies
of company websites. Multiple collection of data was obtained by contacting the case
study companies to carry out interviews, attending case study sites, carrying out
customer analysis questionnaires, emailing questionnaires to competitors, researching
websites and collecting newspaper articles and journal articles for information. The
author also attended seminars, conferences and exhibitions on E-commerce, where
there were presentations and workshops given by experts in E-commerce. Data was
gathered through company exhibitors from their literature and by talking to them about
various concepts.


3.6 Questionnaires and Focus Groups
Questionnaires were used for the feasibility study to ask customers whether they would
prefer to shop online, a mix of open and closed questions were asked. In all cases they
were kept as short as possible while achieving the quality of response required. Each
questionnaire was piloted before use and changes made as required. One of the
weaknesses of questionnaires is the low response rate. A strategy used to improve the

Methodology                                                                 Chapter 3
______________________________________________________________________

response rate was that each questionnaire sent to companies was sent with a stamped
return envelope. Follow up calls were then made to remind the recipients to reply.
However, even with stamped return envelopes and follow up calls the response rate
was often as low as 20%.


Focus groups were originally called “focussed interviews” or “group depth interviews”.
The technique was developed after World War II to evaluate audience response to
radio programs (Stewart and Shamdasani, 1990). A focus group can also be defined as
a group of interacting individuals having some common interest or characteristics,
brought together by a moderator, who uses the group and its interaction as a way to
gain information about a specific or focused issue. Additionally Greenbaum (1998)
suggests that a focus group is an ideal mechanism for gaining a richer and deeper set of
insights into a particular research issue by listening to and learning from a group of
knowledgeable individuals.



3.7 Conclusions
This chapter explains what were the challenges in researching the subject and why a
mixture of surveys and case study research approach was used which is a more of an
interpretivist approach. Research in any new domain is highly risk-prone. Research in
E-commerce was especially challenging. Finally, the research method has been
determined by using previous literature describing case studies, which has been
valuable in identifying the most important points of the case study methodology, as
well as illustrating the weaknesses associated with earlier research. Adopting multiple
methods is important not only to enhance the richness of the findings but also to ensure
validity through the process of triangulation (Stake, 1995).
